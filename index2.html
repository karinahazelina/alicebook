        <h4>TO LEON WERTH</h4>

        <p>
            I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for
            dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best
            friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up
            understands everything, even books about children. I have a third
            reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
            cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate
            the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups
            were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I
            correct my dedication:

            Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
            called <span class="text">True Stories from Nature</span>, about the primeval forest.
            It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an
            animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
        </p>

        <div>
            <img src="img/homework.jpeg" alt="Snake" />
        </div>

        <p>
            In the book it said:
            <span class="chapter">
                "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
                After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
                six months that they need for digestion."
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And
            after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first
            drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
        </p>

        <div>
            <img src="img/homework2.jpeg" alt="Hat" />
        </div>

        <p>
            I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
            drawing frightened them.
        </p>

        <p>
            But they answered:
            <span class="answer">
                "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
            My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa
            constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not
            able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of
            a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They
            always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked
            like this:
        </p>

        <div>
            <img src="img/homework3.jpeg" alt="Hat" />
        </div>

        <p>
            The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
            drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the
            outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history,
            arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up
            what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been
            disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing
            Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and
            it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining
            things to them.
